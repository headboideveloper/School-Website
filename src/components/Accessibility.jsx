of different races, genders, ages and ethnicities. With online and
on-campus learning available, our students are scattered around

We want each student to feel included, supported and recognized
as they earn their degree. No matter where you come from,
earning a degree is a challenging but rewarding venture that
allows you to not only connect and learn from others, but maybe
teach something along the way.
